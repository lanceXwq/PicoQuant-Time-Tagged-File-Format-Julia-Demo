# PicoQuant-Time-Tagged-File-Format-Julia-Demo

Demo Julia code for PicoQuant's time tagged file formats.

This is just an example of how this can be done in Julia and is directly modified from the MATLAB code from https://github.com/PicoQuant/PicoQuant-Time-Tagged-File-Format-Demos.

‚ùó I have only tested this code using some .ptu files from my collaborators. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that it will run for your files. I welcome people to provide example files for further tests.
